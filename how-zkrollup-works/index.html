						GM, I'm AB backend team lead @ PH, and today Im here to talk about how ZKR work.

						<li>Why zkRollups?</li>
						<li>How do they work?</li>
						<li>Problems</li>
						<li>Solutions</li>
						<li>Implementation</li>
					</ol>

					<aside class="notes">
						We'll start with a short intro on why are rollups needed and how do they work in general.
						<br/>
						Then I'm going to give an opinionated answer on if rollups can actually solve the intended problem.
						<br/>
						Finally I'll explain how such a system can be implemented.
						<br/>
						DISCLAIMER: there are many implementation decisions that can be made, some of the stuff that I'll mention refers to how we're doing it at PH.
						Also this talk we'll treat the ZK stuff as a black box. Im not expert in ZK, and I'm sure there is people in this audience that knows way more than me about this topic

					<h2>Why zkRollups?</h2>
					<img data-src="assets/trilema.jpeg">

					<aside class="notes">
						I guess that you all know the blockchain trilema, but anyway:
						<br/>
						The idea is that you cannot have at the same time a system that is fully secure, decentralized, and scalable.
						<br/>
						You've to compromise in one of this areas.
						<br/>
						Rollups are supposed to solve this by borrowing the security and decentralization from a L1, and bringing scalability on top.

					<h2>How do they work?</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						So, how they work? [explain diagram]

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Security?</li>
						<li>Centralization?</li>
						<li>Scalable?</li>

					<aside class="notes">
						Can the trilema be really fixed by rollups? Let's analyze them one by one...

					<h3>Solutions - Security</h3>
					<h1>audit ZK and smart contracts</h1>

					<aside class="notes">
						In terms of security rollups need to add SCs that contain the ZK verifier,
						so as long as those are well audited and tested we could say that yes, we inherit 
						the security of L1... Just like any other SC, [hironic] and as you know, no SC has been ever hacked. 
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Solutions - Centralization</h3>
					<p>Enable multiple operators, <b>consensus mechanisms:</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Governance: DAO decides who has the right to add new blocks</li>
						<li>100% permission less: anyone can create new blocks</li>
						<li>Turn based: SC decide who can add blocks at a given time</li>
						<li>Proof of Efficiency</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Proof of Donation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Implementation of a "turn based" mechanism used in Hermez Network 1.0</li>
						<li>Time slots are auctioned to best bidder</li>
						<li>Auction winner can send blocks in a specific time window</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Proof of Efficiency</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Split the sequence and the proofing in two steps</li>
						<li>Both steps are 100% permissionless (anyone, anytime)</li>
						<li>Two states: virtual vs consolidated</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Solutions - Scalability</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Latency / Finality: L2 >= L1</li>
						<li>Throughput / txs/s: limited by data availability</li>
					</ul>
